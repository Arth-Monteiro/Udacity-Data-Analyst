# 1. Welcome to the Nanodegree Program

The first chapter was an introduction to the following projects of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

This project was about weather trends - was required to apply (atleast) the following steps:

- Extract data from a database using a SQL query
- Calculate a moving average
- Create a line chart

In this report, I will analyze the local temperature trends of some cities and compare with the global temperature trend. The cities analyzed were:
- Guarulhos (Brazil), the nearest city from where I live.
- All the other cities from Brazil on the Data Source.
- 4 other cities around the world.

My intention in analyze the other cities is to compare with Guarulhos and check for similarities.

The tool used was Python, and the libraries were Pandas, for the data analyze, and Matplotlib and Seaborn to the visualization part.

For the moving average metric, I got the average of 7 years period.

My considerations to show the following trends in two different charts, one with local data and other with global data, was because some cities are higher average temperatures than the global average, making the chart's aesthetic bad and confusing when visualization the information.
