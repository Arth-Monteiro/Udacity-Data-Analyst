# 2. Introduction to Data Analysis

This chapter was all about the data analysis process as whole. From gathering to cleaning, assessing and wrangling to exploring and visualizing the data over the programming workflow and communication was everything included.

This project included therefore all steps of the typical data analysis process. This includes:

- Posing questions
- Gather, wrangle and clean data
- Communicate answers to the questions
- Assited through visualizations and statistics.

Here I was confronted with the full joy of a real-life dataset: from hard-to-analyze structure, missing, messy, dirty data to real and - after finally being done with data wrangling - the reward of interesting insights.
