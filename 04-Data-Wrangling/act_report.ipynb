    "First of all, we must consider that the data used has the date range of 15th november of 2015 and 1st august of 2017. But interestingly, over the time, the number of tweets didn't increase so much. There isn't tweets for the same period for each year, but even than, how it's possible to see on the above chart, many of the tweets was made on 2015 (31%). The most part was made on 2016 (50%) and 2017 represents the lowest part (19%)."

    "But with this data it's possible to see that this twitter user got very famous since even with less tweets he got more and more retweets and favorites. At Retweet Metrics, 2016 got more retweets than 2017 and 2015 (chart at first row and first column), but it's necessary to take the note that 50% of our data it's from 2016 and only 19% it's from 2017.\n",

    "With this in mind, I got the proportional count, that is, the total sum of retweets divided by the total count of tweets. And in this way, as the chart on the first column and second row, we see that in 2017 the number of retweets got REALLY higher. \n",

    "For the Favorite Metrics, at the second column, we see a different behavior for the absolute count (first row). There is more favorites in 2017 than in the other years, but for the proportional count (the total sum of favorites divided by the total count of tweets, displayed the the second row) we see the same exponential growth as the Retweet Metrics."

So the dog breed that was posted just once, now would have tha same odds that Labrador Retriever that was posted 97 times.\n",
